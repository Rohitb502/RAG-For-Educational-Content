# RAG for Educational Content ðŸ“š
# Overview ðŸ“œ
RAG for Educational Content is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to enhance how students, educators, and researchers access learning materials.
It combines vector search, knowledge graph retrieval, and large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-rich answers from educational documents.

By leveraging both semantic similarity and structured relationships, this project delivers more relevant and well-contextualized information than standard search systems â€” making it ideal for academic environments.

## Features âœ¨
Document Extraction & Preprocessing â€” Reads and cleans educational material from multiple formats.
Vector Store Creation (FAISS) â€” Generates embeddings and stores them for lightning-fast semantic search.
Knowledge Graph Integration â€” Builds a graph of concepts and relationships for smarter retrieval.
Fusion Retriever â€” Combines vector and graph retrieval for maximum accuracy.
Intelligent Content Generation â€” Produces coherent and fact-rich answers using LLMs.
Automated Evaluation â€” Uses BERTScore for semantic similarity assessment.
