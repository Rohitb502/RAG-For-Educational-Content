ðŸ“š RAG for Educational Content
ðŸ“œ Overview
RAG for Educational Content is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to enhance how students, educators, and researchers access learning materials.
It combines vector search, knowledge graph retrieval, and large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-rich answers from educational documents.

By leveraging both semantic similarity and structured relationships, this project delivers more relevant and well-contextualized information than standard search systems â€” making it ideal for academic environments.
